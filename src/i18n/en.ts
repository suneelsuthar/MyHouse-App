    `To list your parking space on Parking Genius, begin by signing in to your account with your login details. After logging in, find the 'List a Space' option and click on it. Here, you'll be prompted to provide detailed information about your parking space. This should include specifics such as the exact location or address of your parking space, the days and times it's available for bookings, and the pricing you've determined for renting the space.
Consider various factors like the location, local demand, and any special features your parking space may offer when setting the price. To make your listing more appealing, upload high-quality photos that clearly showcase your parking space.
Additionally, you can add any specific instructions or rules for renters, such as maximum stay duration, access instructions, or other relevant details.
After you've completed all the necessary information, submit your listing. At this point, it will enter a pending status, awaiting review by the admin for approval. The admin will assess your listing, ensuring it meets the platform's guidelines.
Once the admin approves your listing, your parking space will transition from pending to live status, making it visible and available for potential customers to book as per their parking needs. Please note that the duration of the admin's approval process may vary, but rest assured that once approved, your parking space will be open for bookings on Parking Genius.`
